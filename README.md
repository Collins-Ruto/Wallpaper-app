# Wallpapers App

Created web this application Reactjs <br>
The images are sourced by the pexels api which is free and very resourcefull <br>
It incoporates realtime image search with input in search parameters <br>
For demonstration purposer the version uploaded here uses a memes api due to it's free to use policy<br>
I have added a backend serice using MongoDB noSql database to store user information and images<Br>
This has also enabled me to store favorite photos of the users which they can access from any device whatsoever when logged in.<br>
I have also succesfully implimented a fully working google auth using one-tap-signin and JavaScript-Web-Token (jwt) for user authentication <br>
Looking forward to adding explore and upload image pages <br>
